Attacks
1. Buffer Overflow
2. Encryption of pin on card
	- Problem - pins would be plaintext on card and easily viewed
	- Solution - encrypted with key / IV unknown to attacker
3. Spoof cards
	- Problem - attacker can create custom card for himself/herself
	- Solution - cards are certified upon creation and violation of this one time certification
		triggers a "bad card" output
4. Input sanatization
	- Problem - user could enter unexpected / harmful input. (withdraw apple) | (balance 55)
	- Solution - Avoid program 
5. 




Our Encryption / Decryption
Encryption
1. right shift bits >> 2
2. xor result with "vlzt"
3. left shift result of that << 3
4. xor result with "aqqe"
5. ~ on result and that is encrypted value

Decryption
1. ~ on the value
2. xor result with "aqqe"
3. right shift result >> 3
4. xor result with "vlzt"
5. left shift result bits << 2
